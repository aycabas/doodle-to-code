# Generative AI and Prompting 101

In this section, you'll learn the basic concepts about Generative AI, Large Language Models, such as GPT, and prompting.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a type of AI that can create new content by learning from existing data. It's like having a smart assistant that can write essays, create images, or compose music based on the patterns it has learned from large amounts of data. For example, if you give it a topic, it can write an article, or if you describe an image, it can generate that image for you.

## Large Language Models

You are probably familiar with ChatGPT, but what is really the GPT? **GPT** stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," has been trained on a vast dataset of text to generate human-like text. This is the heart of LLM, the Large Language Model.

Other LLM like, **Codex** model series is like a specialized GPT, trained on language and billions of lines of code. It excels in Python and other languages like C#, JavaScript, Ruby, and more. **DALL-E** is a modified GPT that crafts images from text descriptions. It's trained on tons of Internet images paired with text captions.

## Prompting

Prompting is your chat with a language model. It refers to the act of giving an AI system a specific instruction or input that guides it to generate a desired output. A good prompt is clear, specific, and structured in a way that directs the AI towards the intended goal.

GPT is a specific type of machine learning model that falls under the category of NLP, stands for Natural Language Processing. NLP enables machines to read, understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that's meaningful and useful.

Let's take an example, *"I am traveling to Japan tomorrow"*

With NLP, the machine can grasp the intents & entities within this sentence for a more meaningful response. And GPT is a multilingual so you can ask the question in other languages including Japanese!
